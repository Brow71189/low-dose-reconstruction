low-dose-reconstruction
=======================

This repository contains all software needed to process a set of raw STEM low-dose images starting from pre-processing until the actual reconstruction process of e.g. defects in graphene by a likelihood maximization<sup>1-4</sup>.

Usage
======

For usage instructions for the different parts of the software see the README files in the subfolders of the repository and the appendix of my PhD thesis<sup>4</sup>.

Installation
============

For installation instructions for the different parts of the software see the README files in the subfolders of the repository.
