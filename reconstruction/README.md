This folder includes the software needed to run the actual reconstruction.

The worker program has to be compiled first by running `make` from within the folder `hexclient`. The compiled executable (also called `hexclient`) then has to be copied to the target computer (which can be a remote computer) into a folder chosen by the user (usually the `home` folder).

The file `nodes.txt` has to be copied into the root folder of ImageJ. It is used to tell the plug-in `Hex_Magic` (which is the master process for the reconstruction) where the workers (`hexclient`) can be found. The example `nodes.txt` file included here just specifies locations on the local computer, but if more computers are available on your network make sure to include them as well because it will significantly speed up the reconstruction process. Usually you want the number of workers per computer (first number in each line, column multiplicity) to match the number of memory channels of this computer, since the reconstruction is limited by memory access speed rather than CPU speed. Keep in mind that the total number of workers specified in `nodes.txt` always has to be at least as large as the number of threads used by `Hex_Magic`. This is especially important when doing a batchrun with several data groups. So you might have to allow more workers per computer than the number of available memory channels.
